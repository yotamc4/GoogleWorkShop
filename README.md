# About us

We are not a shopping site. We are something new and different.

## What is UniBuy?

### For suppliers:

We unite consumers into groups who are willing to purchase in bulk, allow suppliers to browse these groups and make them proposals, and centralizes all details throughout the selling process in case their proposals are selected. In short, we are a new and convenient way for you to wholesale.

### How it all works:

Consumers can join existing group-buys and create new ones from scratch. A group-buy is characterized by a requested product and a maximal price. Suppliers can make proposals for the various groups (if they can provide the requested product for at-most the group’s maximal price), an offer is characterized by a price and a minimal quantity of units.

### When the group's last day to join ends:

If there are no relevant proposals to the group, the group closes.
If there is only one relevant proposal, it is automatically selected, and the group is transferred to the payment stage.
If there are several relevant proposals for the group, a survey is conducted between the group members for 48 hours, at the end of this time frame one proposal is selected (by a majority of votes) and the group is transferred to the payment stage.

## Payment:

The selected proposal’s supplier provides a PayPal.Me link and the group members pay using PayPal, this assures security in payments and provides a dispute system for consumers. When the group is at the payment stage, the group’s page indicates the payment status of each participant. If not all participancts complete payment within 5 days, the deal is cancelled. Otherwise the deal is completed.

### Privacy:

Consumers personal details (such as address, phone number etc) are only visable to chosen suppliers of the group-buys they participate in.
